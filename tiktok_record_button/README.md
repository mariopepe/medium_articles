## The reason

A discord user (of the r/FLutterDev channel) asked to have a record button made in FLutter similar to the TIkTok one.

This is the sample gif I have been given:

This is my version:

## Easily editable

Go to the `lib/common/constants.dart` file to edit every aspect of the animations and the drawings.

If you are looking for even more advanced editing capabilities go to `lib/recording_button/custom_paint` to edit the proportion of the drawing.
